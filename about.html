	<div id="why">
		<h6 >Why is it dangerous?</h6>
		<p>The biggest danger of COVID-19 is that there are many asymptomatic cases. This means that some people may be a carrier of the disease and be unaware, so they can unknowingly spread it to many others. COVID-19 symptoms typically do not present themselves until 5 days after infection, which is why there are many carriers who are unaware of it, increasing the risk of transimssion. There are also many asymptomatic cases which pose a similar danger.

<br>
In general, COVID-19 does not have very serious consequences other than coughing, fatigue and fever for around a week. However, there are some cases that can worsen which can lead to permanent scarring in the lungs or even death. People who are over 60 years old and have existing health conditions are especially prone to this.

		<p>Hospital staff, emergency workers and volunteers are all helping people who have been infected with COVID-19, but by doing so, they are putting their own lives at risk. To help their service to the community, donating can help them receive more supplies like food and water, masks, and other necessities.
