	<div id="why">
		<h6 >Why is it dangerous?</h6>
		<p>The biggest danger of COVID-19 is that there are many asymptomatic cases. This means that some people may be a carrier of the disease and be unaware, so they can unknowingly spread it to many others. COVID-19 also has an average incubation period of 5 days creating a similar danger to the asymptomatic cases. 
<br>
<br>
In general, COVID-19 does not have very serious consequences other than coughing, fatigue and fever for around a week. However, there are some cases that can worsen which can lead to permanent scarring in the lungs or even death. People who are over 60 years old and existing health conditions are especially prone to this.
